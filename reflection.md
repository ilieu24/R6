This project is mostly a demonstrastion of function usage, however, variables were used to create the timer. I knew I wanted to make something colorful because when things are pretty I feel like it is more pleasent for everyone. I also knew that I wanted it to be almost user friendly, so I added a countdown that suggested switching shapes. The countdown uses variables and the entire project uses many functions
